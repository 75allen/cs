* Note that bs4 is not a builtin module, it's considerable to rewrite `<weather.py>` using htmlparser. But it's easier to say/think than to actually get it done(in a pretty way)...

* `weather_htmlparser.py` is `v0.01`. A lot of thing are still to be improved.

* `a.html` and `weather.html` are for test.
