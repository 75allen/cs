#	Update

1.	These two scripts simple show the weather today & tomorrow in SH. Weather info via [Weather China](http://www.weather.com.cn/weather/101020100.shtml)

2.	BeautifulSoup is used as the html parser for `get_weather_with_bs4.py`. So the module bs4 need to be installed when running this script.

3.	Note that if it's too late in the night, today's weather(or tonight's weather) will not be displayed in the `get_weather_with_re.py`, unless you uncomment the commented code.

#	Out of date

Below is the original readme, whose api is no longer usable.

1. This script simply shows the weather today & tomorrow in SH. Weather info via [weathercn](m.weathercn.com)
